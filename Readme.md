Network Chat 1.41
=================

The original Visual Basic 6 source code for my old chat utility, Network Chat 1.41

#### Source Notes:

* Includes Setup_Win.exe to install the application and dependencies (mostly OCX controls). 

* As this was written in Visual Basic 6, originally on Windows 2000 (but compatible with Windows XP) 
there's no guarantee that it'll work as expected with any version of Windows later than XP. *But it might.*

* I'm providing this source code to anybody, for any reason. Do with it as you will. This application is 
(surprisingly) still available from many download sites. 

Here's the original Download.com [download page](http://download.cnet.com/Network-Chat/3000-2085_4-10326659.html).
